Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
Problem:
Create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

Techniques:

Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings can be used to convert textual information into numerical features.
Classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines can be employed for genre classification.
Process:

Data Collection:

Collect a dataset containing information about movies, including plot summaries and corresponding genres.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the textual data, which may involve tasks like tokenization, stemming, or removing stop words.
Feature Extraction:

Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert the text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning models.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM) on the numerical features to predict the movie genre.
Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.


Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Problem:
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions.

Techniques:

Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests can be employed for classification.
Process:

Data Collection:

Collect a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and other relevant details.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing data, and possibly normalize or scale features.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or the area under the ROC curve.


Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Problem:
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business using historical customer data.

Techniques:

Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting can be used for churn prediction.
Process:

Data Collection:

Collect historical customer data, including features like usage behavior, customer demographics, and other relevant information.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing data, encode categorical variables, and possibly scale or normalize features.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.


Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
Problem:
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

Techniques:

Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines can be used for spam detection.
Process:

Data Collection:

Collect a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or legitimate.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the text data, possibly removing stop words or stemming.
Feature Extraction:

Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert the text into numerical features.
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM) to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
